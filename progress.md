Notes on section:

JS runs by hooking into the DOM and making changes to the onpage HTML / CSS. We use a script tag to link it in.

The DOM is the structure of the website and is the canvas upon which JS acts.

Script tag tells the page to look out for Javascript associated with it and points the page at that actual file.
